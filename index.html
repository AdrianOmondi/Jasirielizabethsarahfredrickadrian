        <h3>Jasiri Community Based Information Center</h3>
        <p>We create awereness on alternative energy to people living in rural areas. Consumers lack access to information on the various 
        alternatives of energy available to them, the negative  effects the unclean types
        have on the environment and how they can efficiently make use of energy thus 
        reducing the negative effects of energy wastage. We therefore felt the need to create a community center to educate the community.<br><br>

        <p>Customers
Rural households
<p>They do not have access to information that is readily available due to a number of 
reasons.They are compromised in terms access to energy.They are likely to make use of alternative sources of energy due to availability of 
space.Pain: Isolation/exclusion/limited in terms of options.Feeling; despair, frustration, stuck.Coping mechanism: over reliance on the available sources, derived traditional ways 
of consuming solar, over pricing of energy sources .Impact on lives: disadvantaged girls/women, over priced energy sources.This is a year long problem that they face day in day out
<p>This is fpr customers who do not have access to adequate information that is readily available due to a number of reasons
This customer is also compromised in terms access to energy supplied by the main grid and are likely to make use of alternative sources of energy due to availability of space and resources.
Dues to this this customer experiences feeling of Isolation/exclusion and is limited in terms of development as a result of lack of sufficient and steady energy supply.
This client has also devised coping mechanism such over reliance on the available sources, derived traditional ways of consuming solar, over pricing of energy sources 
The lack of awareness on alternative sources of energy and ways of harnessing them has many negative impacts on the girls/women who spent a lot of time searching for the only available source of energy (firewood). The commodity is also very over priced energy sources due to the level of over reliance

Data 
<p>Exacerbating the current issue is the difference in energy sources used by urban and rural areas of Kenya. The differences in fuel types are based on both cost and availability. In urban areas, electricity accounts of 55 percent of energy used for lighting, followed closely by kerosene at 42 percent. Charcoal, firewood, paraffin, and LPG continue to be the main sources of cooking fuel, while 10 percent of the urban population relies on firewood.In contrast, almost 90 percent of the rural population depends on firewood for cooking and heating, resulting in higher in-home emissions than their urban counterparts. Firewood is also increasingly supplied from private smallholder lands and farm woodlots, making it more challenging for rural communities to afford or access.
